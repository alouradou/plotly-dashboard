During the exploratory data analysis phase, the difficulties encountered are the lack of data that are updated regularly enough. Indeed, apart from the data related to the number of deaths, only the CAC 40 and the NASDAQ are not updated daily. The other data are only updated monthly or annually (as GDP), which prevents us from doing analyses on the effects of covid.
            Second, the time ranges of all these data are not the same, which prevents us from training our models on a meaningful number of points. Given these constraints, to answer the problem, we focused on CAC40 and US GDP data.
