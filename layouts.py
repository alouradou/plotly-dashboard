On the top-left figure, we can visualize the total number of deaths among Covid cases. The x-axis shows the scope of the Covid impact and the slope on y-axis gives rise to the mortality situation per country. On the top-right figure, with stringency index variation, we can further investigate political measurements setted up by each country as a response to Covid peak situations. Finally the left-down graph shows the importance of the epidemic peak on the evolution of the US GDP. We choose US because after our research, the US is considered the most Covid-impacted country of the world. We can observe that during the first peak, the US peak dropped from 21.5 k in early 2020 to 19.5 k during the first peak. Nevertheless,it is interesting to note that the US GDP has recovered its initial level(post - covid) but even that it is increasing faster than before. It would be interesting to compare this curve with that of China - the first country impacted by the crisis, to be able to interpret the potential effect of time scale of the Covid on economic impact.

In order to gather feature and target on the same time scale, our feature - target matrix is limited to 87 data, correspondant to the time period 2019-12-31 to 2020-04-03, excluding on one hand weekends where there is no CAC40 recording, and on the other hand NaN rows, i.e. both feature and target data are NaN.
                            - *Prediction graph*: The plots besides are computed with a 5-tree random forest regressor, they represent the value of the CAC40 as a function of the total number of
                                    Covid cases. We observe that the CAC40 price drops by a third during the first epidemic peak.Then, it stabilizes when the total number of cases reaches 20 k people.Its price even remains constant despite the fact that the number of
                                    cases increases: this is due to the fact that it is not an epidemic peak.A second time, around 57 k cases, a second epidemic peak appeared and the CAC40 price collapsed again.
